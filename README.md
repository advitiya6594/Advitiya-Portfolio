```

## üé¨ GSAP Implementation

The portfolio uses GSAP extensively for:

- **Cinematic Opening**: Timeline-based fade from black with staggered reveals
- **Background Words**: Infinite rotation cycles with transform and autoAlpha
- **Page Navigation**: 3D rotationY flips with transformOrigin center
- **Button Effects**: Continuous glow pulses, shimmer cycles, hover interactions
- **Element Choreography**: Sophisticated timing with delay and easing curves

## üñºÔ∏è Image Placeholder

The central image placeholder is ready for your photo. Simply replace the placeholder content in `CoverPage.tsx` with:

```tsx
<img 
  src="/path-to-your-image.jpg" 
  alt="Advitiya Sharma" 
  className="w-48 h-64 object-cover rounded-lg shadow-lg"
/>
```

## üéØ Customization

- **Content**: Update personal information in `CoverPage.tsx`
- **Colors**: Modify button and badge colors in the component styling
- **Photo**: Replace `/public/coverpage.jpg` with your actual image
- **Background Words**: Customize the `backgroundWords` array for your brand
- **Animations**: Adjust GSAP timing, easing, and effects in the useEffect hooks
- **Typography**: Fonts are loaded via Google Fonts (League Spartan + Space Grotesk)

## üõ†Ô∏è Scripts

- `npm run dev` - Start development server
- `npm run build` - Build for production
- `npm run preview` - Preview production build
- `npm run lint` - Run ESLint

## üñ•Ô∏è Desktop Optimization

This portfolio is specifically designed for desktop viewing with:
- Rich GSAP animations and interactions
